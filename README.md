This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming involving unsafe code and vector manipulation. The `bug.rs` file showcases code that attempts to modify a vector's value through a raw pointer. This approach can lead to undefined behavior and crashes if not handled properly. The solution file (`bugSolution.rs`) illustrates the correct way to interact with vectors to avoid this pitfall.  This is a subtle but crucial point for writing safe and efficient Rust code.
